                <p class="forumPostAuthorAndDate">By OctopusOtaku | Oct-24-17 | 6:23 pm</p>
                <p class="forumPostDetail">It's extinct so it's too late (Sorry RIC lol) but it has been extinct for 30 million years. Basically this new discovery is one of the first ancestors of the cephalopod family. It looks really cool and really creepy too. It looks like a floating alien head with 800 tentacles. What's even scarier about it is their size! You think the giant squid is massive? This species is basically large enough to grab airplanes from the sky and drag them to the ocean! WOOOW</p>

                <p class="forumPostDetail">Hey guys! Our club is running out of funds because our school is cutting off funding our club! Oh yeah, our club is about creating monthly magazines for our school to educate the students about the marine animals. You see the principal doesn't really wanna fund us anymore because apparently nobody reads magazine anymore, but we dont have enough money to maintain a website so we really need your help D:</p>

                <p class="forumPostDetail">So I got my baby cousin that red octopus for her birthday (the one with a face lol) and she won't let it go! Like literally I gave it to her and I haven't seen her let it go once lmao. She takes it to bed, the kitchen, out at the park, and even in the washroom xD. You guys should make more of these like maybe a cuttlefish or squid? Then I'm probably set for the next 3 more birthdays lol :P</p>

                <p class="forumPostDetail">I've been following on the updates on this website, and although the news are quite entertaining, the shop barely improves. Does it have to be a cephalopod? You guys should expand to other marine animals so you guys can sell more types of animal stuff toys. I really like the fabric you guys use so having more options in the store might make me actually buy something (my opinion, pls dont hurt me)</p>

                <p class="forumPostDetail">I really like the nice moustache touch on these little critters! lol It's such a simple design but the material is really soft and plush, and they come in a variety of different colours. This is also perfect for splitting between your friends if you guys pay all together too :P Or it can be for multi purpose as well like me! I bought this bundle and kept the red one, while I gave the others as separate birthday/event gifts huehue~</p>
